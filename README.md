Hello, GitHub Community!

I'm studying Data Engineering at the Universidad Politecnica de Yucatan (UPY). My passion for data and technology has led me to delve into the expansive realms of programming and data analysis, and I am eager to learn and contribute here.

My interest are diverse: I'm a big fan of sports, anime, and manga. I'm also fascinated by the world of finance and how data plays a crucial role in this sector. I believe that data analysis and my personal interest can coexist in creative and cooperative projects, and I'm excited to find out how.

I'm particularly interested in data science, data mining, and decision-making processes. I see these areas as pivotal in understanding and leveraging data effectively, especially in the context of my other interests.

Currently, I use LinkedIn for professional networking and would be delighted to connect with mentors, peers, and anyone interested in these fields. I am here to learn, collaborate, and contribute to the growing world of data engineering. I look forward to sharing projects, ideas, and learning from this vibrant community!

See you in the code!
